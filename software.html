<p>I really enjoy writing software. Good software developers often have a lot to say about the subject, and I usually have a lot to say about everything.</p>

<p>However, I will ramble elsewhere, and here I will attempt to provide a brief description of my own experience, on the assumption that the reader (that’s you) is interested in that.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>03-08 - I was a software Product Manager at 8200 (IDF). My two biggest projects was a knowledge management tool and an in-house BI tool. Both were pretty awesome. I still have a soft spot for knowledge management and BI tools.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I studied Computer Science at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. Double-majored in Psychology. Finished on Dean’s List. My favorite CS topics are computability (Halting Problem, P-vs-NP). Realizing there are some things that are just <strong>incomputable</strong> really expands your mind.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My first job was at NDS (today, a part of Cisco), writing in <strong>JavaScript and Python</strong>. I often think that the language one ‘grows up’ on shapes their go-to paradigm and the way they view software as a whole. Growing up on JS, <strong>dynamic typing just seems natural to me</strong>. As an extension, I am also a NoSQL evangelist.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After graduating, I left Jerusalem to work as a <strong>front-end dev</strong> at a security firm. This was in early 2013, in the beginning of the JS SPA revolution (soon to be known as “JS Framework Fatigue”). Backbone was in vogue; Knockout, Knockback, Angular. React was soon to come out. Silverlight and Flash were just being quietly taken out back and shot. I still have a <strong>“I&lt;3JS”</strong> t-shirt and wear it proudly.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Later, I found myself at <strong>Fiverr, where I really made my bones</strong>. Ruby, Rails, Sinatra, Microservices, DBs, Queues. My first year was on the team in charging of the order flow and the banking system; that was a lot of 3am wake-up calls and white hairs. <strong>When the actual business model is down, you better believe you’re getting up and fixing it.</strong> And then you’re learning how to make sure you won’t need to be woken up again the next time. I also learned to love Ruby, which is by far my favorite language today. If you actually need to get anything done (this includes maintenance), <strong>nothing beats the productivity and sheer joy of doing in Ruby</strong>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After leaving Fiverr I did some freelance work, mostly backend APIs as well as NodeJS and Angular. It was during this period that I learned to really appreciate the awesomeness and expressiveness of <strong>Ruby (on Sinatra) over Mongo, running on PAAS like Heroku</strong>. I am a very fast developer in general, but using the above stack just felt like I was on a jet plane. Nothing took any time, it was amazing. There was no “but… it hurt later to maintain/performance-tune/whatever”. It was just amazing. It still is. Blows Rails/Node/AWS/Microservices/SQL out of the water. As of today, THAT is my choice of stack for any e-commerce/social app.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>In early 2015 I co-founded <a href="https://yes.no">yes.no</a>, a crowd-interviewing social network/platform. As CTO</strong>, it was an interesting exercise in testing many of assumptions and opinions about development. As we grew, hired, and expanded into mobile applications, we (read: I) had to constantly make both technical calls as well as decisions balancing product-tech-time tradeoffs. That is HARD. I am proud to say I believe I/we did an excellent job, as we managed to build and maintain a full-scale social network with all the bells and whistles. The stack proved itself, as well as many other architectural decisions. (This was also a valuable experience in management (and recruiting and retaining engineers) and entrepreneurship, but those are tales for another time; we are here to talk about software). Wary of “JS Fatigue” and despite being an ex-Angular enthusiast (mainly from side projects), I went back to believing in server-side rendering and vanilla JS (+JQ). The stack at yes.no was, in a nutshell, vanilla/JQ JS over server-side rendering on Ruby/Sinatra over Mongo on Heroku. We used LOTS of AJAX of course, mostly utilizing views-over-the-wire (an architecture the latest Rails release espouses as well; Views-over-the-wire enable AJAX views as well as fastest time-to-first-content without replicating templates on both client and server). This stack proved to reliably enable very rapid development as well as maintenance, whereas the negatives (mostly slight performance hits) were minor in comparison. Basically, it worked out so well that I am reluctant to invest in improving my own skills in similar languages (namely NodeJS, Python, Elixir), as it seems Ruby/Sinatra was ‘good enough’ and so insanely productive that it was just never the bottleneck.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The list of technical dilemmas and opinions is long, but today, I know what I “believe” in. Many software engineers annoyingly reiterate the cliche of “the right tool for the right job”, but any good geek has played D&amp;D and knows that <strong>before</strong> you choose your weapons <strong>before</strong> the job/battle, and before you know what you will be up against. Indeed, to the educated craftsman, often your choice of tools <strong>determines</strong> what task you will be up against. In any case, in the realm of web apps, social and e-commerce (where I am mostly interested), my recommended toolbox would be Ruby (Sinatra), PAAS (Heroku), NoSQL (MongoDB), server-side rendering (ERB) with massive client-side JS (vanilla/JQ, no SPA).</p>

<p>So yeah. <strong>Software is awesome</strong>.</p>
