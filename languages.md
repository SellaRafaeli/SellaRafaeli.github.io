I really like studying human languages. 

I speak English and Hebrew as mother tongues. I learned to read English when I was 4, and grew up on fantasy books, primarily David & Leigh Eddings. 



I speak fluent Spanish, after studying and traveling extensively in Central and South America and Spain. I majored in (literary) Arabic in school, and can speak conversational German and Russian (which I am now studying). I learned a bit of Hindu, French and American Sign Language (favorite word: Pizza. To quote one website, "The sign looks as if you are shoving a piece of pizza in your mouth.")

I am not a polyglot, but I wish I were. Feel free to hit me up for any language exchange. :)
