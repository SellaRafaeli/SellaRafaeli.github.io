### Consulting

I am a freelance full-stack web developer / consultant; my previous projects include things like:

* E-commerce marketplaces (like [Fiverr](https://fiverr.com))
* Social Networks (like [yes.no](https://yes.no))
* Back-Ends for Apps 

I am relatively expensive for a single individual, and this is because:

* I am really smart.
* I work really fast.
* I am very experienced in this field. 
* If desired, I do the entire full-stack development myself (I take care of everything personally).

You can read more [about me](/about), about my [software experience](/software) or just [contact](/contact) me with any question or to ask for referrals. 

Happy hacking! :)
