<h2 id="co-founder">Co-Founder</h2>

<p>This summer of 2014, I have been looking for a cofounder. <code>code</code>. If you are reading this, you might be relevant. If you help me find a cofounder - let’s qualify that as someone with whom I will work for 120 days - I will give you 10,000 NIS (or 2,500 USD). </p>

<p>They say finding a cofounder is as hard as finding a romantic partner – someone whose personality (and abilities?) must be a good fit for you, someone with whom you must be able to pass the hard moments as well as the day-to-day toil. And hey, you wouldn’t necessarily expect your romantic partner to know JavaScript. (Or would you?)</p>
