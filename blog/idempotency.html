<p>If you have a BE feature that is complicated and important enough, you’ll want it to be <em>idempotent</em>. </p>

<p>An <strong>Idempotent operation</strong> is one that has the same effects whether executed once or any n &gt; 1 times.  An example would be a ‘Set.add(x)’ or ‘Set.remove(x)’ - obviously these can be called multiple times safely, without having wrongful side effects. An example of non-idempotent operations would be increasing an argument by one, or adding an item to an array. </p>

<p><strong>Idempotent operations are important because they allow complex systems to remain fault-tolerant, in that they facilitate easy recovery from corrupted flows.</strong></p>

<p>Let’s examine this with a real-world example we had at Fiverr. At Fiverr I work on the team in charge of the order flow. Roughly, after a user pays for an order (let’s assume, ordering a 5$ Gig), we perform the following:<br />
  1. <em>Notate the user has paid. *<br />
  2. *Initiate the order, creating the necessary internal objects. *<br />
  3. *Pass the money from the buyer to the seller (Partially/sometimes this involves external systems or payment vendors, such as Paypal.)</em><br />
  4. <em>Pass the relevant commissiona from the transactions to Fiverr (and Paypal).</em><br />
  5. <em>Update all relevant parties (buyer, seller, internal statistics).</em></p>

<p>Naturally, once the successful payment has begun processing, it should finish. Unfortunately, in the wild, things go to shit. Connections timeout, databases crash, runtime exceptions fail and halt the process. Suppose a bug we just deployed has caused a bunch of payments to fail in mid-processing - how can we recover?</p>

<p>Even after creating a ‘re-run’ capability for each payment (which is not obvious, but is the correct first step), we’re still in a jam. First, make sure internal validations don’t give you false negatives to block re-running (e.g. “don’t process payments marked as ‘begun processing’ “). Second, this is where idempotency matters. Suppose we naively re-run the above steps on our failed payment. Every step, depending on the implementation, could introduce corrupt data. For example:</p>

<ol>
  <li><em>Notate the user has paid</em> - If the implementation is of the type ‘user.paid_amount+=5’, then re-running this flow will obviously corrupt the data. </li>
  <li><em>Initiate the order</em> - any internal objects will be created twice.</li>
  <li><em>Pass money from buyer to seller</em>  - doing this twice will obviously have horrendous results, effectively charging the user twice.</li>
  <li><em>Pass commission from transactions to Fiverr/Paypal</em> - once again, we will be passing the commission twice, incorrectly.</li>
</ol>

<p>Clearly, this will be terrible. Multiply this by ten thousand (when it rains, it pours) and clearly it is unacceptable. Now, different payments may fail in different steps - sometimes step 1 crashes, sometimes step 3. Sometimes the failure is a ‘loud failure’ (including a run-time error), sometimes it’s a ‘soft error’, only detectable later. We need a generic method to be able to ‘fix’ any type of broken, semi-processed payments.</p>

<p>The correct way to handle the above would be to ensure the entire flow is <em>idempotent</em>, separately at every level. That is, every level that can fail by itself, should be idempotent, thus ensuring it can be rerun safely. An example implentation would be:</p>

<p><em>Notate the user has paid</em> - ‘user.paid_for_order(order_id) ? return : user.paid_amount+=5’. Now, we can run this step safely multiple times - safely.</p>

<p>Similar logic would be applied at other steps. Basically, each step would be in charge of checking it has been executed on this particular payment/order, and allow a graceful, no-op continuation if so. So if a payment has failed on step 2 - we just re-run it, and step 1 gracefully no-ops. If a payment has failed on step 4, we re-run it, and steps 1-3 gracefully no-op. The genericity earned allows for an extremely simple method of detecting and handling failures – any payment that is not successfully marked as having passed all steps, can be ‘re-run’. (In fact, even successful payments may be re-run, just to be on the safe side, and we are assured no harmful redundant side-effects will occur.) </p>

<p><strong>Now that the flow is idempotent, failures at any point are not a problem - we can just rerun the entire flow, knowing it will no-op the steps already taken, and will perform anything not previous executed.</strong> As in the example above, the implementation is straight-forward. </p>

<p>It’s worth pointing out that idempotency is agnostic to whether each step is performed via a function, a class, or a separate service. It also worth mentioning that SQL transactions are not strong enough to guarantee idempotency flow - while SQL is able to guarantee ‘all-or-nothing’, complex business logic and scale often necessitate spreading a single flow over multiple DBs (some of which might be NoSQL) or altogether external processes, each of which might fail internally. **App-level idempotency, however, insures us from any and every failure - fix whatever failed and just run it again. **</p>

<p>As a side note, this even makes debugging (any flow thus implemented) since you can re-execute the same action over and over, even in production.</p>

<p>For further reading,  see the obligatory and up-to-par <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1077412/what-is-an-idempotent-operation">StackOverflow</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idempotence">Wikipedia</a> references. A quick glance is also recommended at the <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/idempotent">Wiktionary page</a>, where you can see the etymology - <em>idem</em> (“the same”) and <em>potent</em> (power). Ah, everything makes sense. </p>

<p>So - idempotency is awesome. Make your important flows re-runnable. </p>
