A “Wix for Backends”, if you will.</p>

<h3 id="abstraction-is-good">Abstraction is Good</h3>

<p>AWS abstracts away hardware (IaaS); Heroku abstracts away infra (PaaS); logically we can abstract away the platform (BaaS).</p>

<p>In every abstraction we lose granularity and gain simplicity or ease of use. Some people need to fine-tune their own hardware / platform / code; for those people, AWS / Heroku / BaaS is not a good fit. For most applications, they all are - most infrastructures and platforms are identical; everyone runs x86 and needs a load balancer. Similarly, most BEs are either identical (users/posts CRUD) or have a BL (business logic) that can be <em>generalized</em> and abstracted.</p>

<h3 id="dry">DRY</h3>

<p>Entrepreneurs that want to create a marketplace for dogs and dog-walkers or a track-my-beer app or “smart fridge” to monitor your milk consumption - anything from the trivial to the enterprise - have BEs they need to set up. I posit the ‘correct’ approach today is to use IaaS for the infra (goes without saying), PaaS for the platform (not yet consensus, but should be), and, I posit - a configurable BaaS for the logic.</p>

<p>You’ll have some CRUD endpoints, one or more DBs, AuthN-&amp;-AuthZ, emails, push notifs, resource hosting, maybe a CDN, async background workers, cron jobs, a bit of logic. That’s 80% of what every BE entails. One can build a generic, configurable SaaS to allow non-BE devs (or lazy/efficient BE devs) to skip the boilerplate BE code and configure it instead of coding it. As RoR’s convention-over-config mantra encourages: most apps’ BL is, in all honesty, cookie-cutter stuff.</p>

<h3 id="the-others">The Others</h3>

<p>If the reader has been convinced of the merit of BaaS, we can move on to Parse. Parse.com is the biggest name that already proved the product-market fit/demand of the all of the above. It wasn’t perfect, but it was clearly a much-needed tool for indie app devs (and others), and a sign of things to come. FB acquired Parse and recently decided to shut it down; while chump change for FB, this is a world of hurt for Parse’s users. Future users might be wary of lock-in, but the need is still there.</p>

<p>Other big names in the same space are Firebase and Kinvey. Both are large and well-funded but are not very dominant. The Israeli reader might be familiar with BackAnd.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Parse   (founded 2011, acquired by FB in 2013)</li>
  <li>Firebase(founded 2011, acquired by Google in 2014)</li>
  <li>Kinvey  (founded 2010, raised ~10M$)</li>
  <li>BackAnd (founded 2014, raised ~3M$)</li>
</ul>

<p>Obviously, these are just the success stories. However, briefly checking out these companies, I believe it is possible to out-execute them.</p>

<h3 id="business-model--differentiation">Business Model &amp; Differentiation</h3>

<p>The market is big enough for multiple BaaS offerers (similarly to the Iaas/PaaS space), but variations in the market/product could help set aside a competing product.</p>

<p>Here are some of the possible flavours of a BaaS offerer (non-mutually-exclusive):</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Hosted BaaS</strong>. This is the classic, prevalent model of all of the above.</li>
  <li><strong>Open Source</strong> it. Similarly to Wordpress.com/.org model: you can either host it yourself, or use our paid hosting. This benefits from potential community investment in dev.</li>
  <li><strong>Backend-as-a-product</strong>, where the end result is your own running BE over Heroku over AWS, giving the customer a running BE they can extend-modify-control, prevening the danger of lock-in and allowing total customization.</li>
  <li><strong>Humans</strong> - instead of a pure SaaS, let (our) humans configure the BE for you. These humans can be CMS-operators rather than the senior BE devs you would need to build an API from scratch.</li>
</ol>

<p>These are flavours and differentiation which merit more discussion, but the core product is the same - building an abstract BE generator, and a tool to allow humans to instantiate it.</p>
