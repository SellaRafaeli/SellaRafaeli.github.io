<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>There is no God.</strong> I am an atheist.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Spirituality is still important.</strong> There is much to be understood and appreciated about our own reality: our brain and our subjective conscious experience. Our brain is pretty amazing; the very existence of subjective experience is quite profound. Appreciating it is not easy, but it is both enlightening and pleasant - this is something we all should be pursuing, both for academic interest and personal gain.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Free will does not exist.</strong> This is as clear a scientific fact as evolution. We are not in control of our thoughts (this can be attested first-hand by anyone) any more than we are in control of our heartbeat or our digestive systems. The experiencer is not the driver.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Happiness is important.</strong> Everything else can and should be derived by how much happiness it creates for how many people.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>My favorite contemporary philosopher, whose talks and books I recommend in their entirety, is Sam Harris.</p>
