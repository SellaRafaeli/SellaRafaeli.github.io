## Co-Founder 

This summer of 2014, I have been looking for a cofounder. `code`. If you are reading this, you might be relevant. If you help me find a cofounder - let's qualify that as someone with whom I will work for 120 days - I will give you 10,000 NIS (or 2,500 USD). 

They say finding a cofounder is as hard as finding a romantic partner -- someone whose personality (and abilities?) must be a good fit for you, someone with whom you must be able to pass the hard moments as well as the day-to-day toil. And hey, you wouldn't necessarily expect your romantic partner to know JavaScript. (Or would you?)

~~~ ruby
def findCofounder(cand) 
  cand.is_nice? && (cand.strong_programmer? || cand.has_strong_business_skills?)
end
~~~
